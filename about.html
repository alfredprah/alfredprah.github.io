My role as a Senior Data Scientist involves leveraging Data Science, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence to transform data into substantial business value. 
Recently, I orchestrated a win-back campaign that boosted revenue by over 60%. With skills in the Azure stack, Databricks, Snowflake/Snowpark, Synapse Analytics, 
Python, PySpark, SQL, R, React, .NET, JavaScript & Scala, I am fortunate to have what it takes to join teams seeking to optimize data processes, enhance product 
performance and/or realize ROIs sooner rather than later. 

<br><br>

I am also the Founder & CTO at DataN1, an innovation hub that enables me to create AI-powered data products: end-to-end software and data integration, AI and machine 
learning implementation & product management. My latest is <a href="https://genaibro.com/" target="_blank"><u>GenAIBro</u></a>. For each data product created, data points and feedback are used to optimize user experiences 
and increase retention.
