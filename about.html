I am a Senior Data Scientist & AI Engineer, currently leveraging Azure for Data Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning at scale, while creating enterprise tools for Microsoft’s 
VIVA (formerly Workplace Analytics) team at <a href="https://www.launchconsulting.com/" target="_blank"><u>LCG</u></a>.

<br> <br>

At LCG, in my role as a Senior Data Scientist, I have led numerous impactful projects. My achievements include designing and executing a data-driven win-back campaign, resulting in 
a significant 62.10% increase in campaign revenue; reducing the cold start problem of a data product by 25%; optimizing 21 PySpark & Scala notebooks to achieve a 10% reduction in 
latency; and enhancing the performance of four recommender systems in production by an average of 60%.

<br><br>

In addition to my role at LCG, I am also the Founder & Chief Technology Officer at DataN1, where I focus on creating AI-powered data products, with my latest pride and joy being
<a href="https://genaibro.com/" target="_blank"><u>GenAIBro</u></a>. My work on this portfolio of projects involves conceptualizing, designing, and developing innovative AI solutions. This includes end-to-end software and data 
integration, AI and machine learning implementation, product management, data analysis, and optimization. I use data points and feedback to optimize user experiences and increase 
retention, while continually staying updated with the latest trends in AI, machine learning, and data science.
