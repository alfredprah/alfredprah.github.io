I am a Senior Data Scientist, currently leveraging Azure for Data Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning at scale, while creating 
enterprise tools for Microsoft’s VIVA (formerly Workplace Analytics) team at <a href="https://www.launchconsulting.com/" target="_blank"><u>Launch Consulting Group</u></a>.

<br> <br>

At Launch Consulting Group, in my role as a Senior Data Scientist, I have led numerous impactful projects. My achievements include 
designing and executing a data-driven win-back campaign using Snowflake databases and Snowpark infrastructure, resulting in a 
significant 62.10% increase in campaign revenue. I have also been instrumental in reducing the cold start problem of a data product 
by 25%, accomplished by creating and translating UML diagrams into an Amazon Redshift database schema. Additionally, I played a key 
role in refactoring and optimizing 21 PySpark & Scala notebooks, which led to a 10% reduction in latency and adapted the codebase for 
Azure Synapse Analytics. Furthermore, I enhanced the performance of four recommender systems in production by an average of 60%, 
by transitioning from a collaborative-filter approach to a more effective hybrid model incorporating a content-based approach.

<br><br>

In addition to my role at LCG, I am also the Co-founder & Chief Technology Officer at 
<a href="https://carwiz.ai/" target="_blank"><u>CarWiz.ai</u></a> since September 2022. In this capacity, I am at the forefront of 
conceptualizing, designing, and developing the CarWiz platform. My work involves integrating cutting-edge AI and machine learning 
technologies for personalized car selection, steering the technological strategy and fostering innovation within the automotive tech 
sector. My responsibilities encompass a spectrum of roles including full-stack development, AI and machine learning implementation, 
product management, data analysis, and optimization. Additionally, I focus on creating a user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless 
experience for our users. I actively collaborate with various stakeholders, aligning technological development with broader business 
goals, while continually staying updated with the latest trends in AI, machine learning, and the automotive industry.

<br><br>

My journey in data science spans a variety of experiences, from implementing and deploying machine learning models to managing entire 
machine learning pipelines. I oversee project workflows, incorporate third-party data sources, mentor junior team members, and 
effectively communicate complex findings to diverse audiences, both technical and non-technical.
