I'm a Senior Data Scientist who's currently leveraging Azure Synapse Analytics to perform Data Engineering and Machine Learning at scale to 
build enterprise tools for Microsoft’s VIVA (formerly Workplace Analytics) team, through 
<a href="https://www.launchconsulting.com/" target="_blank"><u>Launch Consulting Group</u>.</a>

<br> 
<br>

As a Senior Data Scientist at multiple companies, I have had an extensive range of experiences including implementing and deploying machine 
learning models, managing the lifecycle of machine learning pipelines, overseeing project workflows, expanding data by incorporating 
third-party sources, and presenting findings and insights to teams of people with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.
