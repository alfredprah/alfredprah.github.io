<p>I am currently leveraging Azure Synapse Analytics to perform data engineering and machine-learning at scale, to build enterprise tools for Microsoft’s VIVA 
    (formerly Workplace Analytics) team. As a Data Science Intern at two separate companies, I have had an extensive range of experiences including implementing 
    and deploying machine learning models, managing the lifecycle of machine learning pipelines, overseeing project workflows, expanding data by incorporating 
    third-party sources, and presenting findings and insights to teams of people with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.
  
<br><br>
  
In one of my most recent positions as a Data Science Research Assistant at Vanderbilt’s Research on Conflict and Collective Action (ROCCA) Lab, I worked with 
  faculty members and students to determine which data pipelines best meet the needs of current projects, given the nature of the available data and where 
  applicable, the limitations of the resources at our disposal. My most recent interaction with the team revolved around my recommendations for creating and 
  deploying interactive, client-facing, machine learning applications that are adaptive and stand the test of time.
<br><br>
I am currently open to full-time opportunities.</p>
