I am a Senior Data Scientist currently leveraging Azure to perform Data Science, Engineering and Machine Learning at 
scale, while building enterprise tools for Microsoft’s VIVA (formerly Workplace Analytics) team through 
<a href="https://www.launchconsulting.com/" target="_blank"><u>Launch Consulting Group</u></a>.

<br> <br>

My journey at <a href="https://www.launchconsulting.com/" target="_blank"><u>LCG</u></a> has afforded me the opportunity to 
work with a diverse range of esteemed clients, such as Bowlero, Microsoft, USANA, and Lowe's. These experiences have enriched 
my professional skills, allowing me to provide tailored data solutions across different industries.

<br><br>

In addition to my role at LCG, I am also the Co-founder & Chief Technology Officer at CarWiz.ai since Sep 2022. At CarWiz.ai, 
I spearhead the development of our platform, integrating advanced AI and machine learning technologies for personalized car 
selection. My role involves driving the technological roadmap, ensuring our platform remains at the forefront of the automotive 
tech sector. My expertise in full-stack development, AI and machine learning implementation, and product management allow me to 
lead in conceptualizing, designing, developing, and refining our platform. I am also responsible for data analysis, optimization, 
user interface design, and cross-functional leadership, aligning technology development with business goals and continuously 
adapting to the latest industry trends.

<br><br>

As a Senior Data Scientist, I have had an extensive range of experiences including implementing and deploying machine learning models, managing the lifecycle of machine learning pipelines, overseeing project workflows, expanding data by incorporating third-party sources, mentoring junior team members, and presenting findings and insights to teams of people with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.
