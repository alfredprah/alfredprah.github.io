I am a Senior Data Scientist & AI Engineer, currently leveraging Azure for Data Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning at scale, while creating 
enterprise tools for Microsoft’s VIVA (formerly Workplace Analytics) team at <a href="https://www.launchconsulting.com/" target="_blank"><u>LCG</u></a>.

<br> <br>

At LCG, in my role as a Senior Data Scientist, I have led numerous impactful projects. My achievements include designing and executing a data-driven win-back campaign 
resulting in a significant 62.10% increase in campaign revenue,reducing the cold start problem of a data product by 25%, optimizing 21 PySpark & Scala notebooks to 
result in a 10% reduction in latency & enhancing the performances of four recommender systems in production by an average of 60%. 

<br><br>
In addition to my role at LCG, I am also the Co-founder & Chief Technology Officer at DataN1, where I focus on creating AI-powered data products, my 
latest pride and joy being [GenAIBro.com](https://genaibro.com/). My work on my portfolio of projects involves conceptualizing, designing, and developing 
innovative AI solutions. Specifically, end-to-end software & data integration, AI and machine learning implementation, product management, data analysis, and 
optimization. I use data points and feedback to optimize user experiences and increase retention, while continually staying updated with the latest trends in AI, 
machine learning, and data science.
