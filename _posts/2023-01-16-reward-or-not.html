<h1> Introduction </h1>
In this article, I discuss how we can use Data Science and Machine Learning to reduce churn rates. I.e., the rate at which people unsubscribe from a good or
service, or choose other alternatives over yours. To make this practical, let's discuss this through the lens of a cell phone carrier (Telecommunications Industry).
Some of the popular ones are Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. For the purposes of this article, let's create a new one - EF&G, and let's assume EF&G has the largest market share in 
the industry (Telecommunciations). 
<br><br>
The million dollar question now is, "How can we determine which of EF&G's customers will cancel their phone plans in the near future, if you do not 
proactively reward them through a discount or promotion of some sort?" How do we go about first determining who is at risk of leaving EF&G, and 
what do we do with that information? 
<br><br>
It has become increasingly costly to acquire customers. To put this into perspective, the cost of a 30-second Super Bowl Ad in 2023 is $7 million,
a $500,000 increase from the year prior (2022) & a $1.5 million increase from 2021... for an ad that will costs EF&G $7 million for 30 secs. of airtime, the 
expectation would be to have whichever customers were acquired through the ad to stay with us long enough for us to turn a profit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" target="_blank"><u>(lifetime value of a customer)</u></a>
