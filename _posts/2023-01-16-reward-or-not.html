<h1> Introduction </h1>
In this article, I discuss how we can use Data Science and Machine Learning to reduce churn rates. I.e., the rate at which people unsubscribe from a good or
service, or choose other alternatives over yours. To make this practical, let's discuss this through the lens of a cell phone carrier (Telecommunications Industry).
Some of the popular ones are Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. For the purposes of this article, let's create a new one - EF&G, and let's assume EF&G has the largest market share in 
the industry (Telecommunciations). 
<br>
The million dollar question now is, "How can we determine which of EF&G's customers will cancel their phone plans in the near future, if you do not 
proactively reward them through a discount or promotion of some sort?" How do we go about first determining that any one of EF&G's customers is at risk of 
cancelation and what do we do with that information?
