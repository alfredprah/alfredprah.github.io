<h1> Introduction </h1>
How can we determine which of a business' current customers or subscribers will Churn if you do not Proactively Reward them or meet their needs? 
For a business to become or remain profitable over time, there's the need to position it such that new customers are not only acquired (usually at a cost) but retained. 
How can a business retain customers? In this day and age of a vareity of substitutes for a specific good or service, what can a business/company do to 
ensure that its current customers do not just leave?

In this article, I discuss how we can use Data Science and Machine Learning to reduce churn rates. I.e., the rate at which people unsubscribe to a good or
service, or choose other alternatives over yours. To make this practical, let's discuss this through the lens of a cell phone carrier (Telecommunications Industry).
Some of the top ones are Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. For this article, let's create a new one - EF&G, and let's assume EF&G has the largest market share in 
the industry (Telecommunciations)
