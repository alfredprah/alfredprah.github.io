When conducting experiments or surveys, especially in fields like marketing or social media analytics, it's crucial to:

- Determine the appropriate sample size to achieve desired precision and confidence.
- Understand how to calculate p-values to assess the statistical significance of your results.
- Know when to use different statistical tests and how to interpret them.

This guide walks you through these concepts using practical examples, focusing on estimating click-through rates (CTR) on platforms like Meta/Facebook.

<h3>Determining Sample Size for Estimating a Proportion</h3>

<b>Step-by-Step Method</b>

To determine the minimum sample size (N) required to estimate a population proportion (P) within a margin of error (δ) at a specific confidence level:

1. **Choose the Confidence Level and Z-value**:  
   Common Z-values for confidence levels are:
   - 90%: Z ≈ 1.645
   - 95%: Z ≈ 1.96
   - 99%: Z ≈ 2.58

2. **Decide on the Margin of Error (δ)**:  
   This represents the maximum acceptable difference between your sample estimate and the true population proportion.

3. **Estimate the Population Proportion (P)**:  
   Use prior data or P = 0.5 if unknown for a conservative estimate.

4. **Apply the Sample Size Formula**:  
\[
N = \left( \frac{Z \cdot \sqrt{P(1-P)}}{\delta} \right)^2
\]

<br><br>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<b>Example 1: Estimated Proportion Known</b>

- Estimated CTR (P): 10%
- Margin of Error (δ): 2%
- Confidence Level: 95% (Z = 2)

Calculations yield a minimum sample size of 900.

<b>Example 2: Estimated Proportion Unknown</b>

- P = 0.5
- δ = 2%
- Confidence Level: 95% (Z = 2)

Calculations yield a sample size of 2,500.

<h3>Calculating P-Values and Hypothesis Testing</h3>

The framework for hypothesis testing includes:

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:  
   Null Hypothesis (H₀) assumes no effect, while the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) tests for an effect or difference.

2. **Choose Significance Level (α)**:  
   Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.

3. **Calculate Test Statistics**:  
   For large sample sizes, use the z-statistic:
\[
Z = \frac{\hat{P} - P₀}{\sqrt{\frac{P₀(1-P₀)}{N}}}
\]

<br><br>

<h3>When to Use t-Statistic vs. z-Statistic</h3>

- **Z-Statistic**: Used when population standard deviation is known and sample size is large (N ≥ 30).
- **T-Statistic**: Used when population standard deviation is unknown, especially with small samples (N < 30).

<br><br>

<h3>One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests</h3>

- **One-Tailed Test**: Tests for an effect in one direction.
- **Two-Tailed Test**: Tests for any significant difference, regardless of direction.

Choosing between these depends on whether you are testing for a specific direction or any deviation.

<h3>Comprehensive Example</h3>

<b>Scenario:</b> Testing if a new ad design increases CTR from 5%.

1. **Determine Sample Size**:  
   With a desired margin of error of ±2%, a confidence level of 95%, and an estimated CTR of 5%, you calculate a sample size of approximately 475.

2. **Collect Data**:  
   Sample size: 500  
   Observed clicks: 35  
   Observed CTR: 7%

3. **Conduct Hypothesis Test**:  
   Null Hypothesis (H₀): P = 0.05  
   Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): P > 0.05

4. **Calculate Test Statistic**:  
   Using the observed data, calculate Z ≈ 2.051.

5. **Calculate P-Value**:  
   One-tailed p-value ≈ 0.0202, which is less than α = 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

By following this guide, you can:

- Determine sample sizes for statistical studies.
- Calculate p-values for statistical significance.
- Decide between t-statistics and z-statistics.
- Choose the appropriate hypothesis testing method for your analysis.

In summary, these statistical principles ensure the reliability of your experimental findings and help make informed, data-driven decisions.
