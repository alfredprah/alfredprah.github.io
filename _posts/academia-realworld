# Going from academia to the real world.. 

Academia: focus on model performance (accuracy of predictions). real-world: latency, explainability, maintenance. 
model- development: focus in academia. especially the model training process where the hold out set is usually so small.. 
in the real-world, we care about the model's ability to generalize & make proper inferences. 
"academia prioritizes fast training, whereas production usually prioritizes fast inference". key word in there is "fast". I don't want to go on my 
favorite food app on any given day & wait 10 secs. to see a "for you" listing. 

as a consequence, research prioritizes high throughput while prod. prioritizes low latency. latency & throughput have an inverse relationship.
