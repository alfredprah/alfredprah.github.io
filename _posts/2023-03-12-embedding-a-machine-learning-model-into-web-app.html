<h3> Introduction </h3>
Congrats! You successfully created a Machine Learning model locally. Big first step! After evaluating your model's performance & being satisfied with
the results, how can you go about packaging all of this goodness to share with the world? How can we embed a machine learning model into a web application
that can not only classify but also learn from data in real-time?
