<h3> Introduction </h3>
Congrats! You successfully created a Machine Learning model locally. Big first step! After evaluating your model's performance & being satisfied with
the results, how can you go about packaging all of this goodness to share with the world? How can we embed a machine learning model into a web application
that can not only classify or infer but also learn from data in real-time?

<h3> Saving the current state of a trained machine learning model </h3>
There are a number of options available. However, given how widely Python is considered the go-to language for Machine Learning, I recommend its built-in
pickle module - a module that allows a trained model to persist on a hosted, client-facing platform by allowing us to serialize and de-serialize its
structures to compact byte code. This way, we're able to save the model in its current state & reload if/when we want to classify new samples,
without needing to retrain it from scratch each time we desire a prediction or inference.
