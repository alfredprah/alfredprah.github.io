<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, also known and branded as NCAA March Madness, is a single-elimination tournament played 
    each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college basketball teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate 
    Athletic Association (NCAA), to determine the national championship. The tournament was created in 1939 by the National Association of 
    Basketball Coaches, and was the idea of Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. Played mostly during March, it has become one of the most famous 
    annual sporting events in the United States. In this project, I walk you through the methodology I employed to build a predictive model 
    with a 94% accuracy score (AUC).</p>
